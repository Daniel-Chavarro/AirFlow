    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Entity Relationships}
    The system establishes the following relationships between identified entities:

    \subsubsection{User-Reservation Relationships}
    \textbf{Cardinality}: 1:M (One to Many)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A user can make zero or multiple flight reservations
        \item Each reservation is assigned to only one user
        \item This relationship ensures reservation traceability
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Aircraft-Reservation Relationships}
    \textbf{Cardinality}: 1:M (One to Many)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An aircraft can be assigned to multiple reservations
        \item Each reservation can have only one aircraft assigned
        \item A reservation may initially have no aircraft assigned
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Aircraft-Seat Relationships}
    \textbf{Cardinality}: 1:M (One to Many)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An aircraft is composed of multiple seats
        \item A seat belongs exclusively to a specific aircraft
        \item This relationship defines the physical configuration of each aircraft
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Aircraft-Flight Relationships}
    \textbf{Cardinality}: 1:M (One to Many)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An aircraft may or may not be assigned to an active flight
        \item A flight must have an aircraft assigned
        \item This relationship manages flight operations
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Reservation-Seat Relationships}
    \textbf{Cardinality}: 1:M (One to Many)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A reservation can include one or multiple seats
        \item A seat may or may not be assigned to a reservation
        \item This relationship enables group reservations
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Reservation-Flight Relationships}
    \textbf{Cardinality}: M:1 (Many to One)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A reservation is assigned to a specific flight
        \item A flight can have multiple registered reservations
        \item This relationship links reservations with scheduled flights
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Status Relationships}
    \textbf{Cardinality}: 1:M (One to Many)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A reservation has a unique status at any given time
        \item A status can be assigned to multiple reservations
        \item A flight has a specific status
        \item A flight status can apply to multiple flights
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{City-Flight Relationships}
    \textbf{Cardinality}: 1:M (One to Many)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A flight must depart from an origin city
        \item A flight must land at a destination city
        \item A city can be the origin of multiple flights
        \item A city can be the destination of multiple flights
        \item This structure enables implementation of routing algorithms and graphs
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Design Considerations}

    \subsubsection{Referential Integrity}
    The design implements referential integrity constraints through foreign keys, ensuring data consistency and preventing references to non-existent entities.

    \subsubsection{Normalization}
    The model is in third normal form (3NF), eliminating redundancies and transitive dependencies, which optimizes storage and reduces update anomalies.

    \subsubsection{Scalability}
    The structure allows horizontal growth through implementation of appropriate indexes and partitioning of large tables such as \texttt{reservations} and \texttt{flights}.

    \subsubsection{Flexibility}
    The use of status tables (\texttt{flight\_status} and \texttt{reservations\_status}) provides flexibility to add new states without modifying the structure of main tables.

    \section{Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern}

    The system implements the DAO design pattern to abstract and encapsulate database access, clearly separating business logic from persistence logic. The implementation follows these principles:

    \subsection{DAOMethods Interface}
    A generic interface \texttt{DAOMethods<T>} is defined that establishes standard methods for CRUD operations:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{ArrayList<T> getAll()}: Retrieves all objects of type T
        \item \texttt{T getById(int id)}: Retrieves a specific object by its identifier
        \item \texttt{void create(T object)}: Creates a new record in the database
        \item \texttt{void update(int id, T toUpdate)}: Updates an existing record
        \item \texttt{void delete(int id)}: Deletes a specific record
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Specific Implementations}
    Each domain entity has its own DAO implementation that extends the generic interface:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{FlightDAO}: Manages CRUD operations for flights
        \item \texttt{ReservationDAO}: Manages CRUD operations for reservations
        \item \texttt{UsersDAO}: Manages CRUD operations for users
        \item \texttt{AirplaneDAO}: Manages CRUD operations for aircraft
        \item \texttt{CityDAO}: Manages CRUD operations for cities
        \item \texttt{SeatDAO}: Manages CRUD operations for seats
    \end{itemize}

    This structure ensures uniformity in data access and facilitates code maintainability by centralizing persistence logic.

    \subsection{SQL Query Methods}
    DAOs implement various SQL queries to satisfy system requirements. Below are some relevant examples:

    \subsubsection{FlightDAO Queries}
    The FlightDAO class implements complex queries including flight searches with status information and multi-criteria filtering based on origin, destination, and date parameters.

    \subsubsection{ReservationDAO Queries}
    The ReservationDAO handles user-specific reservation retrieval and seat availability verification through join operations between multiple tables.

    \subsection{Database Connection Management}
    Database connection management is centralized in the \texttt{ConnectionDB} class, following the Singleton pattern to optimize resources. The connection configuration includes Unicode support, SSL configuration, and comprehensive exception handling.

    \subsubsection{Transaction Handling}
    The system implements transaction control for critical operations such as flight reservations, ensuring data integrity even in complex operations affecting multiple tables through commit/rollback mechanisms.

    \section{System Architecture}

    \subsection{General Description}
    The flight reservation application architecture is based on a layered structure that clearly separates the different system responsibilities. The main architectural layers are:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Presentation Layer}: User interface and interaction
        \item \textbf{Model Layer}: Data representation in the application
        \item \textbf{Persistence Layer}: Data access and management in the database
        \item \textbf{Service Layer}: Business logic
        \item \textbf{Utility Layer}: Tools for different layers
    \end{itemize}

    This layered architecture promotes separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability while ensuring clear boundaries between different system components.
